# ShieldOfStamina
simple SKSE plugin making blocking only costs stamina
Does three things:
1. blocking only costs stamina. Health damage is negated at the moment of damage calculation and turned into stamina damaege.
2. when the blocked attack has more damage than the blocker's current stamina is able to handle, the blocker staggers.
3. stifles stamina regen when actor is blocking.
